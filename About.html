      <div class="pawn">
        <h3>Pawn</h3>
        <p>
          A pawn may move by vertically advancing to a vacant square ahead. The
          first time a pawn moves, it has the additional option of vertically
          advancing two squares, provided that both squares are vacant. Unlike
          other pieces, the pawn can only move forwards. In the below diagram,
          the pawn on c4 can only move to c5; the pawn on e2 can move to either
          e3 or e4. When capturing the opponent piece it can move diagonally on
          step. If the white reaches the top row it can be promoted to any other
          pieces of the same color except the pawn itself and king. Same for
          black pawns that reaches the bottom row.

      <div class="Night">
        <h3>Night</h3>
        <p>
          A Night move in a lit bit complicated way compared to the other pieces
          and that makes it special. It moves in “L” shape i.e. It can move one
          square vertical then two squares horizontal or two square vertical
          then one squares horizontal to every direction contained in the board.
          It can move to any empty space whether there is any piece on the way
          or not. and to move and capture is the same. I think this feature
          makes Night so unique and so powerful in some positions. By the way
          Night is my favorite piece.

      <div class="bishop">
        <h3>Bishop</h3>
        <p>
          A bishop moves diagonally following its position color. i.e. If there
          is a bishop on black square that means that bishop can only go to
          black squares following diagonal direction. It can not pass a piece on
          the way. If the piece on the way is your opponent piece you can
          capture that piece and settle there.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="rook">
        <h3>Rook</h3>
        <p>
          A rook can move in any straight line direction whether it is
          horizontal or vertical direction. It moves and captures in same
          manner. When countering pieces on the way if it is opponent piece it
          can capture it and settle there or if it the same color piece it can’t
          pass it so if there is empty squares before the occupied square it can
          settle there.
        </p>

      <div class="queen">
        <h3>Queen</h3>
        <p>
          A queen can move both diagonally and in any straight line direction,
          i.e. It can move like a bishop or a rook. The movement rules that
          apply to the bishop and the rook apply to the queen too. Since the
          queen can easily move the entire board easily it the second most
          powerful piece on the board next to the king.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="king">
        <h3>King</h3>
        <p>
          The king is most powerful and most prioritized piece among the chess
          pieces. It is due to the concept of the chess game is based on which
          is the “capture” of the king or checkmating the king. So in chess your
          main aim should be protecting your king and mobilizing your pieces to
          checkmate the opponent king. The king can move in all directions one
          square inside the board. and it move and capture in the same manner.
        </p>

    <h2>Concepts and Rules</h2>
    <p>
      The main concept in the chess i think is check and checkmate. Where check
      means that placing your one of your piece(except the king) to a place
      where it is possible for the piece that is placed in that position to
      capture the opponent king. when you put your piece in that position it is
      called check. And if the opponent can't do anything to not be captured by
      that piece then it is called checkmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Game over rule is simple if you can checkmate your king you have won.
      If any of the opponent king is not possible to be checkmated in a fair
      game then it is draw. But there are still some rules that you should know
      like un'passant or you can't move your king to a square where it is
      possible for your opponent pieces to go that position. You can checkout
      all the concepts and rules <a href="">here</a>.
