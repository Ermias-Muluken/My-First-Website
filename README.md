# My-First-Website
This is a website about my favorite game in the whole world which is Chess.
I started in figma designing wireframes for my website.
You can checkout the designs in the Pdf file or the images in the design directory.
And then I started building the structure of the website using html.
Finally tried my best to make the user interface look better using CSS.
