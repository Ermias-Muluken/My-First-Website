      <h2>What is Chess?</h2>
      <div class="what-chess-description">
        <p>
          Chess is a board game for two players, called White and Black, each
          controlling an army of chess pieces, with the objective to checkmate
          the opponent's king
        </p>
        <p>
          It is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information
          and no elements of chance. It is played on a chessboard with 64
          squares arranged in an 8×8 grid
        </p>
        <p>
          In chess, the player who moves first is called White and the player
          who moves second is called Black. Their pieces are the white pieces
          and the black pieces. The pieces are often not literally white and
          black, but usually contrasting light and dark colors. The 64 squares
          of the chessboard, which is colored in a checkered pattern, are
          likewise the "white squares" or "light squares", and "black squares"
          or "dark squares"; they are usually of contrasting light and dark
          color rather than literally white and black.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king, i.e. threatening
          it with inescapable capture. There are also several ways a game can
          end in a draw.

    <h2>What is it about Chess?</h2>
    <p>
      Chess requires a lot of focus and concentration – to the point where you
      may end up so focused on the game that the rest of the world around you
      temporarily fades away. For many players, chess is a way to forget about
      the stresses of the world, and focus on the game at hand.
    </p>
    <h2>Beauty of Chess</h2>
    <p>
      There are no age, gender, cultural, or language barriers in the game of
      chess – meaning you can play the game with anyone. During chess classes,
      children get a chance to socialize with others, and have fun in the
      process of learning how to play. And since the game can be played online,
      you can easily reach players from around the world
