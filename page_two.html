      <h2>How did I start playing?</h2>

          <p>
            I remember playing chess in desktop computers when I was child like
            in lower grades. But honestly I do not remember how i played or even
            understood the game back then. So let me jump to the time I
            consciously started to play chess. It began when I was in High
            school. In my way to school there is a place that is kind of simple
            lounge that i pass through everyday and I was always attracted to
            the gathered people there. They were always there playing chess
            every single day. And I was curious that what made them to play so
            seriously but at the same time they chatter so much and laugh a lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I started to just stand and watch them play for some quiet
            days. One day one of them asked me to come and play with them I told
            him that i don’t know to play. Then he recommend some online videos
            to start of from the ground and know some basic things about chess(
            like movements ,checkmate and some opening). After Completing the
            recommended videos I asked to play with them. They asked the
            beginner player among them to play with me. We started to play and
            he smacked the heck out of me. I remember going home so angry and I
            couldn’t sleep thinking about the games. After this I watched some
            additional videos and try to understand the underlying concept of
            chess. I started playing with chess bots and got better. I returned
            to place and challenged him again. This time I also won a few games
            and that boost my confidence and started to play on forward

            Well now I am university student and far from my home town where I
            stared to play chess. Since there is no close place and much free
            time available to play chess. I switched to play online in sites
            like Chess.com and Lichess.org. I go in to this platforms as much as
            time I get to play with players all over the world. It is so cool to
            play with people that are from all over the world.
