    <h1>Me and Chess</h1>
    <h2>How did I start playing?</h2>
    <p>
      I remember playing chess in desktop computers when I was child like in
      lower grades. But honestly I do not remember how i played or even
      understood the game back then. So let me jump to the time I consciously
      started to play chess. It began when I was in High school. In my way to
      school there is a place that is kind of simple lounge that i pass through
      everyday and I was always attracted to the gathered people there. They
      were always there playing chess every single day. And I was curious that
      what made them to play so seriously but at the same time they chatter so
      much and laugh a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I started to just stand and watch them play for some quiet days. One
      day one of them asked me to come and play with them I told him that i
      don’t know to play. Then he recommend some online videos to start of from
      the ground and know some basic things about chess( like movements
      ,checkmate and some opening). After Completing the recommended videos I
      asked to play with them. They asked the beginner player among them to play
      with me. We started to play and he smacked the heck out of me. I remember
      going home so angry and I couldn’t sleep thinking about the games. After
      this I watched some additional videos and try to understand the underlying
      concept of chess. I started playing with chess bots and got better. I
      returned to place and challenged him again. This time I also won a few
      games and that boost my confidence and started to play on forward
    </p>
    <h2>What about now?</h2>
    <p>
      Well now I am university student and far from my the town where I stared
      to play chess. Since there is no close place and much free time available
      to play chess. I switched to play online in sites like Chess.com and
      Lichess.org. I go in to this platforms as much as time I get to play with
      players all over the world. It is so cool to play with people that are
      from all over the world.
